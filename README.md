# '`portage-brew`' Staging and Evolution

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository tracks the ongoing staging and evolution of '`portage-brew`,' a nascent alternative to [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), 'the missing package manager for macOS,' meant to support those who prefer building from source.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspired by [the deprecated/obsoleted 'Homebrew Evolution' repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew-evolution).
